Features
--------
* prodyn uses the dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the decision seuqence which leads to minimal total costs
* prodyn can be apllied to any system function which follows the required structure for inputs and outputs
* Forward and backward implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm
* Supports systems with multiple state variables



Get Started
-----------

1. `download`_ or clone (with `git`_) this repository to a directory of your choice.
2. Copy the ``prodyn.py`` file in the ``prodyn`` folder to a directory which is already in python's search path or add the ``prodyn`` folder to python's search path (sys.path) (`how to`__)
3. Run the given examples in the `examples` folder.
4. Implement your own system function.
